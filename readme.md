## A good web design always consists of:

1. Color Theory
2. User Interface Design
3. Typography
4. User Experience Design


## Color Theory 

1. It is all about using complementing colors to express what your website is trying to sell or convey.
2. https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel -> to create custom color patterns and visualize
3. https://colorhunt.co/ -> similar website


## Typography
Gives us an understanding of how to choose a font according to the scenario.


## UI design
When working on this it is important to understand the five things -> hierarchy, layout, alignment, white space (around and between elements) and audience (the people we are catering to).

## UX Design
1. Always keep it simple.
2. Keep designs consistent throughout.
3. Follow an F-layout for the reading patterns. Have the most important content on the left, logo at the top and keep following the pattern.
4. Another is the Z-layout. Typically for websites that need fast browsing and have video content.
5. Efficiently switching between screen sizes and accommodation content accordingly.

## Three ways to add Java Script (JS)
1. Inline
2. Internal using script tags.
3. External by linking the JS file to HTML file using the script tag.

## Document Object Model (DOM)
1. Gives the ability to catalogue the webpage into individual objects to be able to select and manipulate.
2. Ways of getting an element:
    1. querySelector
    2. getElementsByTagName
    3. firstElementChild
    4. lastElementChild
    5. getElementsByClassName
    6. getElementsById
    7. querySelectorAll
    8. .classList -> used to return a list of the classes attached to any element
    9. .attributes -> gives a list of all the attributes attached to a HTML element
    10. getAttribute -> for getting a specific attribute of an element
    11. setAttribute(attribute_name, what_to_be_changed_to) -> to set value for a specific attribute of an element
3. Query Selector can be used in this way too:
    1. document.querySelector("h1") -> to get the tag
    2. document.querySelector("#title") -> to get by Id
    3. document.querySelector(".btn") -> to get by class
    4. document.querySelector("li a") -> example of getting the "a" tag inside "li" (hierarchical)
