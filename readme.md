## Typography
Gives us an understanding of how to choose a font according to the scenario.


## UI design
When working on this it is important to understand the five things -> hierarchy, layout, alignment, white space (around and between elements) and audience (the people we are catering to).

## UX Design
1. Always keep it simple.
2. Keep designs consistent throughout.
3. Follow an F-layout for the reading patterns. Have the most important content on the left, logo at the top and keep following the pattern.
4. Another is the Z-layout. Typically for websites that need fast browsing and have video content.
5. Efficiently switching between screen sizes and accommodation content accordingly.
